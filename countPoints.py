# 1828. Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle
# Medium

# You are given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] is the coordinates of the ith point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the same coordinates.

# You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj] describes a circle centered at (xj, yj) with a radius of rj.

# For each query queries[j], compute the number of points inside the jth circle. Points on the border of the circle are considered inside.

# Return an array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]
# Output: [3,2,2]
# Explanation: The points and circles are shown above.
# queries[0] is the green circle, queries[1] is the red circle, and queries[2] is the blue circle.
